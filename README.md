# tk
Another micro game engine for JavaScript called Tiknee (pronounced "Tiny".. but I really like TK Burger so I needed something with a 'k' in it so that it could be called the "TK" engine.. this is clearly super important stuff to include in the description text and extremely relevant to the engine development itself /s).
