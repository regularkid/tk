# tk
Another micro game engine for JavaScript called Tiknee (pronounced "Tiny".. but I really like TK Burger so I needed something with a 'k' in it so that it could be called the "TK" engine.. this is clearly super important stuff to include in the description text and extremely relevant to the engine itself /s).

## Features:
+ Not much!
+ Tiny game loop!
+ Dirt simple "state management"â„¢!
+ 2 whole functions for drawing things (image / text)!
+ Uses the wonderful ZzFX sfx engine (https://github.com/KilledByAPixel/ZzFX)
+ Less than 100 lines of code!
